1. do logistic regression
   the goal of this step is to set every tweets a attitude leave or stay

   The independent variable: polarity, subjectivity, words nouns, hash tags
   The dependent variable: Assumption we made, if it contains synonym of contain or leave, we combine with the sentiment, to decide the attitude.
   (Actually we should analysis the potential error or disadvantage there and the method we use to deal with with this problem, as best as we could)
   We could use 4 model
   (We may be need more label.....)
        (1) logistic regression, which we may choose sm package
        (2) SVM which we will find some model....
        (3) Naive Bayes...
        (4) Multi-perceptron neural network

Now what we should do
1.  Figure out how to use naive bayes to solve..
    basically the input and the output..

remain : stay, left wing, 
leave: right wing
